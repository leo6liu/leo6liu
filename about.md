# Hi, I'm Leo.

I'm most proud of my little web-dev projects! Here are a few:

- **The Quick Brown Fox** (https://fox.subparprogramming.org/): An interactive Japanese hiragana reference chart (japanese alphabet). It's built using `Next.js (React)` and deployed to GCP Cloud Run using GitHub Actions (for CI/CD).

- **Udon Code Studios** (https://udon.studio/): My personal website which is branded as a fake company (It used to be called Subpar Programming: https://subparprogramming.org). I use it to store notes and list my projects. It's built with responsive design meaning it's mobile friendly! It's built using `Next.js (React)` and deployed to GCP Cloud Run using GitHub Actions (for CI/CD).

- **LoL Time** (https://lol.udon.studio/): A League of Legends stat site which is currently under development. You can search for `Rocket the dog` if you don't have your own account. It's built using `Fresh` a cutting edge web-framework for `Deno`. It's deployed using Deno Deploy in their super awesome edge network. The coolest part is that it deploys instantly and has no package installs and no compile step!!! It just JIT executes the TypeScript on request.

- **AlgoSim** (https://algosim.subparprogramming.org/algo-v1): A UI and backend which allows users to simulate custom on-the-minute trading algorithms on historical stock data. It's backend is written in `Go`, it's frontend uses `create-react-app`, and their both deployed to GCP Cloud Run using GitHub Actions (for CI/CD).
